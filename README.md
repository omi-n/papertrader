# papertrader
CSC473 project

An application that allows people to manually or programmatically test out trading strategies with fake money. The application is a layer over a few APIs which provide stock data, but also has its own backend to store the user’s trade history, profits, losses, and balance. The application also has a developer API to allow people to test their trading strategy, which would show up on the user’s dashboard to manually analyze.
